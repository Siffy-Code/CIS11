Files included:

src.zip 			- contains ".s" files for both versions
StreetLight Writeup.docx	- Explanation of program and features (assumes version 1)
Image 				- shows breadboard setup
Schematics and Prep.pdf 	- original design and hardware layout plan

Note:
	It was unclear whether or not to have a yellow light for the crosswalk.  Since it
was easy to re-adapt the program, I have included two versions - one that uses only two
lights for walk (red and green) and one that uses 3 lights for walk (red, yellow, and green).
I sent an email on 20221208 inquiring as to if it mattered which way, but I'd like that 
"Early Bird Bonus" on the project (and to wrap it up and call it done!) so I made both for you!

Thank you for the class, it was very fun!
